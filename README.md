# Iris data analysis

Apply some basic statistics and visulization techniques on iris dataset

### Tasks:
- Calculate the average value and standard deviation for each of the four features.
- Repeat the previous step but separately for each type of flower.
- Draw four box plots, one for each feature, such that each figure shows three boxes, one for each type of flower. Properly label your figures and axes in all box plots. Make sure that the box plots
look professional and appear in high resolution. Experiment with thickness of lines, font styles/sizes, etc. and describe what you tried and what looked the most professional.
